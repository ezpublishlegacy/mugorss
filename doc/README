MUGO RSS
============

The extension exports content as an RSS feed or allows to read
an RSS feed to render it in the eZ Publish installation.

Rendering external RSS feeds
------------------------------

The extension comes with classes to parse a RSS feed to an array.
You can use that functionality from PHP or from the template engine.
You need use the fetch function 'mugorss', 'get_rss_feed' in order
to get an RSS feed into the template context.
On top, the extension provides a basic custom tag to allow editor
to include a RSS feed. The custom tag template is fetching the RSS
feed and includes a 2nd template to render the RSS feed.

Render internal content as an RSS feed
----------------------------------------
Develop a template that does the fetch of the content you'd like to
include in the RSS feed. Configure that template in mugorss.ini.
Use override templates with the view 'rss' to render content objects
as RSS entries.
